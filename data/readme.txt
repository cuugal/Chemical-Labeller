All converted to xls. (xlsx not supported)

HSIS_extract converted so there was one checmical per line (all cells unmerged, all rows without chemical names deleted)

GHS_Chemical_List is simply "GHS Hazardous Chemical Information List (No Search Version)" from http://hsis.safeworkaustralia.gov.au/GHSInformation/GHS_Hazardous_Chemical_Information_List with the non-list sheets deleted, and the top line being the header rows (there were some erroneous rows above removed).
